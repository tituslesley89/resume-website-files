      <description>During my Virtual Reality Course (Master&amp;rsquo;s) we had to come up with a system to construct and de-construct Lego. The project was done as a team of 3 developers and 2 artists.
The system was developed using FIVE-UDE version of Unity (A custom made Unity Version for developing application for the UTDallas Motion Capture Lab). We had access to a Motion capture Lab which used Vicon Cameras to track the motion of the users Oculus Rift (DK1) and 2 Wii Controllers.</description>

      <description>My thesis work was to study the trade-off between usability and fidelity in a modern VR set-up, in the domain of user training.
For the highest possible fidelity (at the time) we used the latest Oculus Rift (DK2) and a Creative DepthSense camera (depth camera) for user interaction.
Challenges:   Finger-tracking : This took a major part of the development time, getting the perfect position and filtering the tracking information for reliable and consistent tracking was a challenge.</description>

      <description>During my Creative Automata class (Master&amp;rsquo;s) we had learned about Digital signals and Automata theory. At the end of the course we had to create something that represented all the things we had learned over the course. I have gotten these from pictures and files stored around my PC, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the original project unfortunately
Introduction: Playing music on any instruments and creating a song requires a sequence of instructions to be executed at certain times.</description>
